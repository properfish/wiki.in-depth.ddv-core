### Features
**ON BY DEFAULT**:
- Base Game Fixes / Tweaks
  - This covers the vast majority of the "patch" that this plugin is mainly created for:
    - StoreStage adjustments, which allow the vast majority of the previously "pouch-exclusive" items to appear in Scrooge's store (full credit to Romi on the specific pointers for these).
    - ItemWeight adjustments, which greatly reduce the odds of repeat spawns in Scrooge's store (full credit to Romi on the specific pointers for these).
- Infinite Gliding
  - Gliding/Sprinting will no longer consume / drain the stamina/energy meter.

**OFF BY DEFAULT**:
- Immediate Scrooge Resetting
  - Scrooge's shop will immediately reset upon exiting the shop and reentering, thus nullifying the need to wait any length of time to "refresh" the store.
- No Currency Spending
  - Any attempts at spending currency will be effectively canceled, thus leading to "free" items in Scrooge's (and _maybe_ other places)
- Pickup Duplication
  - Based fully on **aedenthorn**s original mod at: https://www.nexusmods.com/disneydreamlightvalley/mods/5
- Infinite Mana
  - Based fully on **aedenthorn**s original mod at: https://www.nexusmods.com/disneydreamlightvalley/mods/1
