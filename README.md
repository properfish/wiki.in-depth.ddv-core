### Features
- Immediate Scrooge Resetting
  - Scrooge's shop will immediately reset upon exiting the shop and reentering, thus nullifying the need to wait any length of time to "refresh" the store.
- Infinite Gliding
  - Gliding/Sprinting will no longer consume / drain the stamina/energy meter.
- No Currency Spending
  - Any attempts at spending currency will be effectively canceled, thus leading to "free" items in Scrooge's (and _maybe_ other places)
